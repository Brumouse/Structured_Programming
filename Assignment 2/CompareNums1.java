//Version 1.0.1
//The purpose of this program is to read two numbers in String form from the
// user, convert these two Strings to integers, compare the two numbers and then
// print the results of the comparison back out to the user.

//The import statement is a convenience statement that saves typing for the
// programmer.  The full name of the JOptionPane class is
// javax.swing.JOptionPane.  Every place in the program that we wanted to use
// the JOptionPane class we would have to use its full name if we did not use an
// import statement.  The import statement allows the programmer to only have to
// use the name JOptionPane to refer to this class instead of its full name.
//
//Import statements are not like C include statements and they do not copy any
// text into the source code.
